NOTE: graphics.py is the Zelle graphics library, and each program using this library is in a folder with the file. This is the only file in the repository that I did not code myself. All of the files in the repository are in Python.

1.	aspirations_bootstrap: This is a small website on Python coding using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The landing page is home_page.html, but any of the others should lead to this as well.

2.	aspirations_pong: This is a version of the game Pong, in which one player uses the up and down arrow keys to control their paddle and the other player uses the E and S keys.

3.	aspirations_python_misc: This is a collection of some miscellaneous programs that I have made:
  a.	connect.py uses the Zelle graphics library to create a shape out of points that the user inputs on a window.
  b.	rock-paper-scissors.py is one of my earlier programs, simulating a randomized game of rock paper scissors with the computer and a user.
  c.	tic-tac-toe.py simulates a game of tic tac toe, with the user playing against the computer.
  d.	visual-sort.py is a visual representation of selection sort using the Zelle Graphics Library.

4.	aspirations_reader.py: This allows users to “purchase” and read different book files through a Kindle-like platform called swindle.py. The book files are already inside of the folder, so the program reads directly from each file.

5.	aspirations_jupyter_data-science.ipynb: This is an example of a Jupyter notebook with descriptive statistics using the American National Election Studies 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey. I used libraries such as Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Seaborn to create graphs and data frames that convey the relationships between my variables of social media use, misinformation, and faith in experts.
